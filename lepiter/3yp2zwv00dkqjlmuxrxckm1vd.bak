				"string" : "##Definition\nA slot has several meanings depending on context:\n1) A *slot* is another word for intance variable. An instance variable takes up a slot of memory.\n2) A slot can also refer to **an object whose responsiblity is to encapsulate the behaviour associated with an instance variable**. This includes accessing the contents of the instance variable.\n\nThe later concept was introduced by Marvin Minksy and colleagues in his work on Frames and Slots at MIT. Basically, a Frame is composed on one to may slots which help describe the Frame. This work was expressed in [LISP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language))  related languges such as [CLOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp_Object_System)."

He said the ICE (Inter-Contintental Excahnge) would not be suitable because of the performance requirements. They had even turned garbage collection off while trading was in progresss.\n\nIt is important to note that all of the systems described above were using GemStone by GemTalk Systems."
